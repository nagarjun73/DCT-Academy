*Task: Expense Tracker App*

Build a React app that enables users to track their expenses. The app will allow users to add, view, edit, and delete expense entries. Additionally, implement user authentication to ensure secure access to expense records.

*Requirements:*

1. *Login Component:*
   Create a `Login` component where users can enter the predefined password ('secret123') to log in.
   
   - Provide an input field for the password.
   - Compare the entered password with the predefined password ('secret123').
   - Set an authentication flag upon successful login.

2. *Dashboard Component:*
   Design a `Dashboard` component that displays a user-specific dashboard after successful login.
   
   - Display a welcome message with the user's name.
   - Allow users to access their expense records and perform CRUD operations.

3. *ExpenseList Component:*
   Develop an `ExpenseList` component that lists expense entries for the logged-in user.
   
   - Display a list of expense entries with minimal information (date, description, amount).
   - Clicking on an entry show to the `ExpenseDetails` component.

4. *ExpenseDetails Component:*
   Create an `ExpenseDetails` component that presents the full details of a selected expense entry.
   
   - Display the complete details of the expense (date, description, amount, category, notes).
   - Provide options to edit or delete the expense.

5. *AddExpenseForm Component:*
   Develop an `AddExpenseForm` component that allows users to add new expense entries.
   
   - Provide input fields for date, description, amount, category, and notes.
   - Upon submission, add the new expense entry to the list and local storage.

6. *EditExpenseForm Component:*
   Implement an `EditExpenseForm` component that enables users to edit an existing expense.
   
   - Pre-fill input fields with the current details of the selected expense.
   - Update the expense details upon submission.

*Authentication and Data Persistence:*

1. Implement user authentication by comparing the entered password with the predefined password ('secret123').

2. Utilize local storage to store and retrieve user-specific expense data.

*User Flow:*

1. Users open the app and access the `Login` component.
2. Users enter the predefined password ('secret123') and click the login button.
3. Upon successful login, users are shown to the `Dashboard` component.
4. In the dashboard, users can view and manage their expense records.
5. Users can add, edit, and delete expense entries using the appropriate components.

*Guidelines:*

- Utilize React's state management to handle authentication and expense data.
- Use component state and props to pass data between components.
- Implement CSS or a styling library for user-friendly styling.

*Bonus:*

Enhance the app by adding features like expense categories, filtering options, and total expense calculations.

*Note:*

This task provides a comprehensive foundation for building an Expense Tracker app with user authentication using React. Feel free to customize and expand the app based on your creativity and expertise.
