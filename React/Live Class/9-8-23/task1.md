*Task: Note-Taking App with Local Storage*

In this task, you will be building a React app that enables users to create and manage notes. The app will utilize local storage to ensure that the notes persist even after the page is refreshed. Additionally, you will create a separate `NoteForm` component for adding new notes.

*Requirements:*

1. *App Component:*
   Create an `App` component that serves as the main container for the note-taking app.

   Implement the following functionalities:
   - Display a header for the app.
   - Integrate the `NoteForm` component to add new notes.
   - Include the `NoteList` component to display the list of notes.

2. *NoteForm Component:*
   Create a component named `NoteForm` that provides an input field for users to add new notes.

   Implement the following functionalities:
   - Render an input field for the note's content.
   - Include an "Add Note" button to submit new notes.

3. *NoteList Component:*
   Create a component named `NoteList` that displays a list of notes.

   Implement the following functionalities:
   - Retrieve notes from local storage when the component mounts.
   - Display each note in a list format.
   - If there are no notes, display a message indicating there are no notes.

4. *NoteItem Component:*
   Create a component named `NoteItem` to represent each individual note in the list.

   Implement the following functionalities:
   - Display the content of the note.
   - Provide a "Delete" button to remove the note.

5. *LocalStorage Management:*
   Implement logic to manage notes using local storage.

   Implement the following:
   - When a new note is added, store it in local storage.
   - When a note is deleted, remove it from local storage.

*Guidelines:*

- Utilize React components to structure and manage the app's UI and state.
- Create and integrate the `NoteForm` component for adding new notes.
- Use local storage to ensure notes persist even after the page is refreshed.
- Implement appropriate event handling for adding and deleting notes.
- Consider using CSS or a styling library for basic styling to enhance the app's visual appearance.

*Bonus:*

Enhance the app by adding features like editing notes, organizing notes with categories or tags, searching for specific notes, and providing user-friendly error messages.

*Note:*

This task provides a more structured approach by introducing the `NoteForm` component for adding new notes. You can further customize and expand the app based on your creativity and skills.
